# Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts sales using historical data with a **Linear Regression model**. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model evaluation, and visualization.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature transformations)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations 
- Feature engineering (log transformations, revenue calculation, seasonality factors)
- Linear Regression Model with evaluation metrics (RMSE, R²)
- Interactive visualizations of predictions vs actual sales
